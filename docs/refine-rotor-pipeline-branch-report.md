# Refine SO(4) Rotor Pipeline & Extrument Mapping – Branch Report

This report documents the impact of the "Refine SO(4) Rotor Pipeline and Extrument Mapping" branch and
identifies how its outcomes shape the staged rebuild blueprint. The branch consolidated the six-plane
rotation kernel, tightened the uniform-buffer contract, and formalised the path from sensor input to
external "extruments" (external instruments).

## Purpose & Scope

- **Rotation kernel fidelity:** Align matrix, sequential, and dual-quaternion paths around a single
  `RotationAngles` ordering so every subsystem reads identical SO(4) snapshots.
- **Uniform-buffer contract:** Centralise std140 buffer allocation and updates through
  `RotationUniformBuffer` to prevent diverging uniforms across render programs.
- **Extrument integration:** Normalise IMU snapshots and expose adapter plumbing so external devices or
  controllers can publish/subscribe to rotation updates without bespoke wiring.

## Code Differences & Stability Impact

| Area | Refinement | Stability Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rotation math | Shared helpers for sequential rotations, matrix construction, and dual-quaternion composition reuse the same plane ordering. | Eliminates drift between ingestion, CPU checks, and GPU shaders during long sessions. |
| Uniform updates | `RotationUniformBuffer` owns buffer layout, binding, and updates. | Keeps every render path in lockstep with deterministic std140 uploads. |
| External mapping | IMU packets pass through calibrated gains, confidence scoring, and adapter registration in `ExtrumentHub`. | Supports multiple adapters without cross-talk while preserving deterministic telemetry. |

The consolidation improved both maintainability and runtime determinism; tests cover rotation energy,
sequential parity, and adapter broadcasts to guard future refactors.

## Experimental & Integrative Capabilities

- **Sensor-driven instrumentation:** Calibrated gain matrices translate gyro/accel input into spatial and
  hyperspatial planes, making it simple to onboard new IMU devices or MIDI controllers.
- **Audio/visual weaving:** Existing shader/audio bridges reuse the refined uniform bus so six-plane
  snapshots can drive reactive visuals and external synths simultaneously.
- **Operator tooling:** Console panels expose geometry, ingestion, and telemetry controls, letting QA teams
  exercise the refined pipeline while observing latency, confidence, and manifest metrics.

## Commit-Level Highlights

1. **Rotor pipeline optimisation** – refactored sequential rotation helpers, shared plane ordering, and
   dual-quaternion composition to guarantee parity across math paths.
2. **Extrument mapping integration** – introduced the `ExtrumentHub`, MIDI adapter, and snapshot
   normalisation so multiple external instruments can subscribe to the rotation bus.
3. **Documentation alignment** – updated architecture and rebuild references to match the refined kernel,
   manifest workflow, and external adapter contracts.

## Recommended Continuation Strategy

The "HypercubeCore – CPE Rebuild Blueprint" is the strongest platform for continued development. It reuses
this branch's deterministic kernel while delivering a staged MVP:

1. **Stages 0–1:** Stand up the trimmed `/core` layout, reuse the refined rotation helpers, and add parity
   tests that compare sequential, matrix, and dual-quaternion paths across randomised inputs.
2. **Stage 2:** Reintroduce the minimal geometry catalog, keeping meshes GPU-resident and feeding them
   directly from `RotationUniformBuffer` uploads.
3. **Stage 3:** Extend the extrument mapper into the parserator service, layering profile presets and a
   deterministic uniform sync queue to guarantee one snapshot per frame.
4. **Stages 4–6:** Layer projection bridging, dataset export, HAOS orchestration, and CI tooling on top of
   the stable rotation bus, using the manifest and telemetry contracts validated in this branch.

Following this plan yields a lean yet extensible MVP while preserving compatibility with external
instruments, dataset pipelines, and future HAOS integrations.
